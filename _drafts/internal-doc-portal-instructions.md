### WRITING GUIDELINES

- Articles are stored at the top level. Follow existing articles as examples for structure/syntax

#### Markdown syntax guidelines

For consistency's sake, we are going to [standardize which markdown options/syntax we will be using][docs-markdown] as we write our articles. 


#### Writing style/voice {#voice}

- Friendly but matter-of-fact
- It's okay to use adjectives, adverbs and words like "please" but do not overuse!
- Simple is best, try not to be too "conversational"
- Keep in mind that non-native English speakers are also reading our docs
- Write to the audience: "You can log in to our management portal", "We offer a variety of options..."

#### Punctuation for items in bulleted/ordered lists {#list-punctuation}

- If there is a full sentence, it needs to end with a period.
- There should be no period if it is not a proper sentence.
- Imperative sentences (where the subject is implied as "you") should end with periods. 
   - Example: "Click the "Tools" tab."
- Capitalize the first word for each item in a list.
